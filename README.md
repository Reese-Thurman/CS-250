CS-250 Projects (Software Development Lifecycle)
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
> The best way to interpret user needs and implement them into a program is through user interviews and the creation of user stories. A user story describes a program feature from the viewpoint of the user. User stories developers understand what the user requires in order to develop the best solution.
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
> The best approach to developing programs is a flexible, iterative approach using the Agile metholdogy, which is generally composed of six phases- plan, design, develop, test, review, and employ. Implementing scrum features of the agile process, such as sprints, daily meetings, and sprint reviews will be incorproated into my future development work.
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
> Being a good team member in software development requires open communication and collaboration. These skills are important to working as a cohesive group to accomplish goals during the software development lifecycle.
